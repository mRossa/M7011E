<p>The idea is to merge some basic concepts of some famous social medias into one website. An user should be able to write posts or questions under different kind of categories
with subcategories, so the user easily can search for the different post they are interested in. An example of a category is food and a subcategory for that is recipes. </p>
<p>A post can be either text, picture, video or a combination of either of them. For example you can upload both text and picture or a picture and video in a single post. 
Other members should be able to interact with other users posts and questions, for example like posts and answer questions. Regarding the questions, 
the user asking a question may set a state on the question whether it is answered or not, kind of like StackOverflow. </p>
<p>As we all know, there are some trolls and horrible people on the Internet which may comment or answer questions in a rather coarse way.
To handle that we decided to use a flag system with a point system called credibility. If a user think that the answer or comment were inappropriate they should be able to flag it.
This will notify the user which wrote the answer or comment and send to the admin. The administration receives the flag and can then review it, if it finds it breaking the guidelines 
it will flag the user and the users credibility will be lowered. If the user's credibility hit the lower limit the user will be banned from the site. </p>
<p>An user should be able to increase their credibility if another user asking a question is content with the answer the user gave them. Users should also be able to search 
after their friends and follow them with a simple click. They may also chat with each other, even if they are not friends with each other. They should also be able 
to block each other. But this is something that will be implemented if we are very productive. </p>
