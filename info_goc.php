<h1> About GoC </h1>
<b>GoC</b> started as a project in the course <i>Dynamical Web Application</i>.<br> 
You can see the first idea of the project by clicking on this link:<a href="./info.php"> Project Idea</a>. <br>

<b>GoC</b> can stand for many different things but one of them is Girls on Computers. We wanted to have a nice name and a unik name, wow what we failed there. <br>
In the begging the site was up for just us and the teacher but we always wanted it to be big later on.
