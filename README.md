# M7011E
A project in the course M7011E. This is a start to a blog and question site.
If you want to add run this code yourself you need to download bootstrap and add it to the same folder as the other files. You also need to add a folder called Images and a folder called Files, in the files folder you should add the pass.ini file. 
This is a work in process but as of right know you can register as a member and thereby add new posts, comment, like and view post. You can also login through facebook but unfortunally here you can only view others posts, comment and like. This is something we are working on right know. 
The website is up and running on https://iladid3.ddns.net
